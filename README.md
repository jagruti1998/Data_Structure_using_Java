# Data_Structure_using_Java
My notes on Data Structures.....

Data structures describe, how to store the data in memory so that the computer can perform operations on data efficiently.

**Topics**

**ARRAY**
The most important factor is it uses contiguous memory allocation of data where a block of memory is reserved for a data structure.
It is an infinite collection of homogeneous(similar type) elements.

Brief description or introduction to the topic.
- [array creation](src/arrays/array_creation.java)
- [array insertion](src/arrays/array_insertion.java)
- [array deletion](src/arrays/array_deletion.java)
- [2-D array](src/arrays/two_D_array.java)

**Advantages**
- Allow contiguous memory allocation
- Can store multiple data of the same type using a single variable
- Access time T(n)=o(1)

**Disadvantages**
- Insertion Time Complexity T(n)=o(n)
- Deletion Time Complexity T(n)=o(n)
- The sie of the array should be known in advance
- Wastage of memory if data is not stored as per the size of an array declared

**Applications**
- Seraching
- Sorting
- Matrix Operations
- Can Implement stack, queue,tree graph
